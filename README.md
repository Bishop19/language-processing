Language Processing Projects in C (using Flex, Gawk and Yacc)

## TP1
This project allows abstract creation from Wikipedia pages, using the Flex tool. It also creates a HTML page for every article in 
a given category.

## TP2
This project allows the processing of a Formation Processes File and is built with GAWK. We can clean up empty processes and create DOT
graphs using the information on the file. This file must have .csv formatting.

## TP3
This project allows Thesaurus ISO 2788 (T2788) format processing, using the Yacc tool.
